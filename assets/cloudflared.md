# Setting Up Moat with Cloudflared (Cloudflare Tunnels)

**Conceptual Overview:**

1.  **Moat:** Runs on your local server (or inside a Docker container on that server), listening on a local port (e.g., `localhost:8000`). It handles authentication and reverse proxies requests to your backend services.
2.  **Backend Services:** These are your actual applications, running locally (e.g., `localhost:3001`, or as Docker containers like `http://my-app-container:80`). Moat needs to be able to reach these on the local network.
3.  **`cloudflared`:** A small daemon from Cloudflare that runs on the same server as Moat. It creates a secure, outbound-only connection to Cloudflare's edge network.
4.  **Cloudflare's Edge:** When a user accesses your publ

orrect.
*   **Redirect Loops:**
    *   Verify `moat_base_url` in Moat's `config.yml` is **exactly** `https://moat.yourdomain.com` (or your equivalent).
    *   Check `X-Forwarded-Proto` and `X-Forwarded-Host` headers. Cloudflare tunnels generally set these correctly.
*   **Cookie Issues / Not Staying Logged In:**
    *   Ensure `cookie_domain` in Moat's `config.yml` is correct (e.g., `.yourdomain.com`).
    *   Check browser developer tools to see if cookies are being set for the correct domain.
*   **DNS Issues:** Ensure your DNS records created via `cloudflared tunnel route dns` have propagated. Use `dig` or `nslookup` for your public hostnames.
